                          CLEANED DATASET

## DATA PROCESSING 

	Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle .

	Remove Duplicate

	Convert data type to where necessary 

	Then I transform my cleaned dataset using the power bi app.

The steps in cleaning a datasets can varies depending on the data used .

DATA ANALYSIS
The dataset was transform in the power bi app where I removed unnecessary column,I renamed my dimension table after removing  the unwanted columns,  I also included the date table extracted the year, week and quarter.

    DATE 

Then I created a model to connect my data together in the power bi app. This analysis doesn’t require a pivot table since I am using the power bi.
